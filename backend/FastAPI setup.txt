Make sure you cd into wherever the backend folder is on your PC.

Windows:
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

Mac:
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

Once these commands are succesfully completed use the command: uvicorn main:app --reload to start up your FastAPI server.

I have created some API route tests on app.js so when you load app.html you should be seeing successful console output from the chat and ticket route.
