Make sure you cd into wherever the backend folder is on your PC.

Windows:
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

Mac:
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

Once these commands are succesfully completed use the command: uvicorn main:app --reload to start up your FastAPI server.

You will also need to go into the .env file within the backend folder and add in the API key, replace your_api_key_here filler text with the actual key.
