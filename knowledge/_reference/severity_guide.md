# Severity Guide

Use these severity tags consistently across issues.

- **S1:** Service outage, security risk, suspected compromise, account disabled, or user cannot work at all.
- **S2:** Major degradation or repeated failures that block core tasks; workaround is limited.
- **S3:** Minor issue, “how to”, or workaround exists; user can continue working.
