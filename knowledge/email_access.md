# Email Access Troubleshooting (Tier 0/1)

## Scope
Basic guidance for users who cannot access email or believe messages are missing.

## Procedure
1. Confirm whether the issue occurs in **webmail** and in the **desktop/mobile client**.
2. Confirm the user can sign in to other company services.
3. If using Outlook:
   - Restart Outlook
   - Confirm the account is not in offline mode
   - Try webmail as a control test
4. Missing messages:
   - Ask the user to check Junk/Deleted Items
   - Use search by sender and subject

## Escalation criteria
Escalate if:
- Multiple users are impacted
- The user cannot sign in to webmail
- There are repeated password prompts despite known-good password and working MFA

## Ticket notes
Include:
- Client type (Outlook/OWA/mobile)
- OS
- Symptom description
- Scope (one user vs many)
